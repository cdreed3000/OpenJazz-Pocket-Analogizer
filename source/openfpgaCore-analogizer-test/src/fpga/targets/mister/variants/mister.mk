# MiSTer variant: mister (the target's only variant, and its default).
#
# DEFS is the ADDITIVE feature module list (a feature is PRESENT iff its
# INCLUDE_* macro is listed) — same registry model as the pocket variants.
# Each entry is forwarded to quartus_map as --verilog_macro=<NAME>; the
# gpu_core / axi_periph_slave instances in emu.sv echo each macro into their
# INCLUDE_* params via the `ifdef INCLUDE_X 1 `else 0 `endif pattern.
#
# MiSTer has the full feature set EXCEPT analogizer (Pocket-only HW) and
# fast texture memory (no CRAM1 chip — textures render from SDRAM).
# LINK + 4PLAYER dropped 2026-06-27 (module audit): LINK is stubbed in
# emu.sv (advertised cap, no HW, no firmware check) and 4PLAYER is a dead
# macro on MiSTer (the only gate is pocket core_top.v; MiSTer multiplayer
# comes via HPS/USB).  INCLUDE_LINK=0 folds the periph link logic — the
# same config pocket already ships — so this is low-risk, but RE-FIT
# MiSTer on Quartus 17 to confirm.
#
# The variant's CPU config (dual issue for the DE10-Nano's A6/I7 grade)
# lives in src/fpga/vendor/vexriscv/configs/mister.cfg.  The fitter seed is
# committed in seeds/mister.seed (+ .seed.src fingerprint) and sed-patched
# into mister.qsf by `build` — the Q17 flow builds in place, with no
# bld/<job>/ isolation.

# These two implementation choices are fitted for MiSTer. Keep them absent
# from Pocket variants: enabling them there regresses timing at the stored seed.
# INCLUDE_CLK_AUTOTUNE (v0.9, the SHIPPING config): self-tuning clock —
# Reconfigurable VCO-900 pll_sys (C0 /9 = 100 MHz default, runtime /10 =
# 90 MHz) + clk_autotune.v + the boot-ROM SDRAM probe.  A board whose
# SDRAM fails the probe at 100 MHz (marginal PLUGGABLE dual-chip modules,
# e.g. stock DE10-Nano + 128 MB module) drops ITSELF to 90 MHz — one C-
# counter rewrite, no relock, bridge paused, warm reset, frequency-meter
# confirmed; the boot console prints the chosen clock.  Replaces the
# separate mister90/compat90 manual-install build (variant kept for
# experiments).  STA closes at 100 MHz; the 90 mode is the same placement
# 11% slower (mister90 HW-proved the 90 MHz physics on SS1 + DE10; the
# runtime switch HW-validated on the SS1 2026-09-05, forced + ear/screen).
#
# INCLUDE_CLK90 (fixed 90 MHz build) parked 2026-08-26: the VCO fix +
# M2-fairness ride along ifdef'd/always-on respectively; superseded by
# CLK_AUTOTUNE above (see project memory mister-sdram-module-timing).
#
# INCLUDE_SDRAM_2T (typically together with NO_A12_DQM_MIRROR) — DE10
# dual-chip 128MB module experiment: true 2T commands via a live registered
# nCS (io_sdram.v Stage B; +1 cycle per command, 2x command+address setup).
# Append to DEFS for the experiment build ONLY — do NOT commit it enabled;
# the shipping build must stay 1T (zero netlist change without the macro).
# Any DEFS change trips the seeds/mister.seed.src fingerprint: re-sweep
# (`make sweep TARGET=mister`) before drawing any hardware conclusion.

# MISTER_FB / MISTER_FB_PALETTE are framework macros, not INCLUDE_* feature
# modules: they unlock the sys/ direct-framebuffer interface (emu FB_* ports
# + ascal core palette) that the ddr3_fb pipeline drives.  They ride DEFS so
# every quartus_map (build AND sweep) sees them uniformly.
