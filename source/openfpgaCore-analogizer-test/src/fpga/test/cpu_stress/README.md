This freestanding RV32IMAFC program tests integer/FPU forwarding, atomics,
trap returns, cached memory, and 1,960 float-to-integer conversion cases.
Conversion expectations and exception flags come from a Python reference,
including all five rounding modes, signed/unsigned limits, NaNs and infinities.
Subnormals are excluded because the shipping CPU is configured to ignore them.

From `src/fpga/test`, build the MiSTer CPU benches and run the program:

```sh
make obj_dir_system_mister/Vtb_system obj_dir_system_sdram/Vtb_system
make -C cpu_stress run
make -C cpu_stress run BENCH="$PWD/obj_dir_system_sdram/Vtb_system"
SCAN_PERIOD=700 SCAN_LEN=128 SCAN_PHASE=317 \
  make -C cpu_stress run BENCH="$PWD/obj_dir_system_sdram/Vtb_system"
```

The test firmware builds in the official firmware container. Its private boot
ROM and binaries stay under `obj_dir_cpu_stress`; shipping firmware is untouched.
The SDRAM bench exercises the controller with concurrent video scanout and
checks read data, write delivery and protocol ordering. Success prints
`CPU stress PASS` followed by the bench's normal boot marker.
The last command increases scanout traffic to exercise instruction fetch and
trap returns under heavier memory backpressure.

From the repository root, also run:

```sh
python3 tools/check_vexii_interrupts.py
```

This isolated fixture connects the real peripheral timer to the CPU and enables
periodic machine interrupts throughout the same workload. It checks that at
least 200 interrupts complete while preserving the computation, synchronous
trap count and memory checks. `--netlist` selects another generated CPU for
comparison; `--output` selects an isolated build directory.
